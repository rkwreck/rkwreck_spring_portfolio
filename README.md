## TBD [Spring Portfolio Starter](https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com/projectsearch/details/Spring%20Portfolio%20Starter)
Runtime link: TBD https://jportfolio.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/

## Visual thoughts
#### * Starter code should be fun and practical
#### * Organize with Bootstrap menu 
#### * Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
#### * Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, Youtube
#### * Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page
#### * Show student TPT ideas
#### * Show student About me pages



## Getting started
#### * Clone project to IntelliJ
#### * Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adopt-openJ9-15) 
#### * Play or entry point is Main.java, look for play option in tray.  This file eanbles Spring to load
#### * Java source (src/main/java) had Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  Note, html 
#### * HTML source (src/main/resources) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by defaul in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building a "@Controller"



## IDE management
#### * A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
#### * A "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.



## Scores
#### * Chenxin:
#### * Rachel:
#### * Rini:
#### * Maggie:

## Ideas/Planning
#### * Purpose: Reporting stock market & local house pricing
#### * About page: greet function that shows secret after entering name, pictures of everyone, short bio about each person
#### * Progress/Feedback: wireframe is detailed (good job); nav bar completed (good job); collected info/pics for about page (good job); next start making the Java controlls + buttons (match up with wireframe)
