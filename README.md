#### * About page: greet function that shows secret after entering name, pictures of everyone, short bio about each person
#### * Progress/Feedback: wireframe is detailed (good job); nav bar completed (good job); collected info/pics for about page (good job); next start making the Java controlls + buttons (match up with wireframe)
